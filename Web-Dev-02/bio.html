                <p>
                    Hello! I'm John Doe, a passionate web developer and designer based in New York City. With over 5 years of experience in the tech industry, I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and applications. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the city's art galleries, hiking in the Adirondacks, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in the power of technology to connect people and solve real-world problems. My goal is to create digital experiences that are not only functional but also meaningful and enjoyable for users.
                </p>
