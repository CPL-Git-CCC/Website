  <p>Design is Dead rebuttal.</p>
<p>While I can agree AI has it's benefits in like it serving as a search tool. In terms of creativity the AI lacks. For example let's say I ask for the AI to write a story of two characters falling in love. It is going to do so, but it's output is at best rather Generic and is going to be at best one page worth.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective for Web Design while I could use AI to create a Header that has a Rainbow color background. If I try to have the AI make a full website for political Advocacy it's only going to create a single web page with basic and generic details.</p>
