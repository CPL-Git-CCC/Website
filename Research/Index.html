        <h2>Railroad Labor Dispute Summary</h2>
        <p>In late 2022, Congress intervened to avert a potential railroad strike affecting over 100,000 workers across major freight railroads. Key points from the Congressional Research Service report:</p>
        
        <ul class="summary-points">
            <li><strong>Legislative Action:</strong> The House passed two bills (H.J.Res. 100 and H.Con.Res. 119) to impose a September 2022 tentative agreement and propose paid sick days</li>
            <li><strong>Labor Conditions:</strong> Railroad employment had declined by 20% (40,000 jobs) since 2018 due to coal industry changes and "precision scheduled railroading" (PSR) efficiency measures</li>
            <li><strong>Key Issues:</strong> Workers demanded better sick leave policies (only 3 unpaid days in proposal), opposed aggressive PSR implementations, and sought crew size protections</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> Negotiations were governed by the Railway Labor Act, with President Biden establishing an Emergency Board in August 2022 after failed mediation</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> While 8 of 12 unions ratified agreements, 4 rejected them, bringing the system to the brink of a December 9 strike before congressional intervention</li>
